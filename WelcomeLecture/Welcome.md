<!-- 
    This is essentially my linked in profile.  I also worked at Carlson as a student web developer on systems like the Carlson public homepage (before the current technology), a version of the alumni network application, the learning management system before we used Moodle, and the MBA application student tracking system.  It was in that role that I first started using Agile.  My first role at General Mills was where I had a team lead who was also an early Agile advocate and coach.  His role after he left my team was self titled ‚ÄúAgile Bigot‚Äù.  I moved onto a project team where we used Agile processes for a couple of years with a relatively stable team.  I did a host of other projects using Agile processes right as General Mills was moving from bottoms up Agile to a more tops down understanding.  I was an early consultant for the team working to provide best practices for Agile to all of IT.  I was an early Agile coach ‚Äì not as a formal role, but as a helper to teams that were just adopting Agile.  While moving into the Supply Chain space as an analyst and as a manager, I helped move my team and surround teams to adopt more agile processes.  My immediate team was much easier because they were already doing the process, they just had a different vocabulary for it.  Now as a solution architect on product information, I provide technical and business process architecture as well as technical coaching for two teams that both use different levels of agile processes.

    I‚Äôve taught this particular course once before and played the role of product owner for this course twice before when Corrie F was teaching it.

# **Deliverables**
 - Attendance / Participation
    - Show up, give thoughts, exit ticket
 - Homework
 - Midterm
 - Agile Topic Presentation
 - Final

 <!-- 
 Attendance and Participation
Attend via Zoom
If you are ill or caring for someone who is ill, the lectures will be recorded ‚Äì this should be reserved for those that are in this situation
I‚Äôd like advance notice of you missing the class ‚Äì ideally 24 hours
Participation is based on you asking questions, providing your thoughts, etc.
This should earn you 3 or 4 points
An extra point is available by submitting questions via Canvas meant to be used on the midterm or final
3 or 4 questions is enough

Homework
This is similar to every other class
See notes about team sprint

Exams
The midterm will be done via Canvas the week of April 6.
The final exam will be done via Canvas either on a scheduled day or similar to midterm ‚Äì it depends on how it goes.
Exams are a combination of multiple choice and short answer questions to test your grasp of the theory and (mostly) the practice of Agile methods.
Exams will be timed, so while you might be able to use lots of notes, the time will work against you.
Exams will be administered electronically.  
The midterm exam will be about 30 minutes.  It is low-stakes.  The primary purpose is to ensure you understand my exam style.
The final exam will be about 60 or 75 minutes.

Team Sprint
Each team will be responsible for one lecture.  
The particular date will be picked early in the course.  The team will be responsible for selecting and sizing the user story(ies), building a description and acceptance criteria, and developing the story.
In class, the team will present the topic and teach it to the rest of the class.  They can use pre-readings, homework, in-class exercises, or input from external speakers to teach the class.  The team will then ensure they have met the acceptance criteria to complete the story.

Definition of Done: User stories assigned one week before lecture, story description and acceptance criteria approved three days before lecture, pre-readings and lecture materials submitted one day before lecture, and homework uploaded day of lecture, acceptance criteria met with approval from product owner or proxy.

Agile Topic Presentation
Each team will identify an epic related to emerging Agile trends or tools.  
All deliverables (except the final presentation) are due on Friday night at 11:59pm. 
On March 27, you need to have a topic picked and sent to Sean.  
It‚Äôs first come first serve ‚Äì if you pick a topic someone else has picked, I‚Äôll ask you to choose another  
You can change or refine the topic as you go with Sean's approval, however the closer you get to the final presentation, the harder this will become.
Each Friday following March 27 (April 3, April 10, etc) until the final presentation, you are required to submit evidence of progress via submission of agile activities.  
Evidence is due each Friday evening by 11:59pm

<!-- 
A Final course grades are performance-based. Your grade is based solely on your performance: thus collaboration and team-work are highly encouraged.
 
At my discretion, these targets may be moved down, but will not be moved up.
 
The University defines C level effort as work that "meets the course requirements in every respect." Based on this definition, students expecting an A or B level grade in the course should be prepared to demonstrate learning above and beyond the classroom.
